Automatic Image Captioning, using Deep Learning and Flickr-8k Dataset. Also made a comparison between Xception Model and Inception Model.

This is the easiest way to generate captions and alt text for all kind of images using Convolutional Neural Networks and a type of Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM).
